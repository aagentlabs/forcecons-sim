# forcecons-sim
distributed consensus simulation

### how simulation works
nodes:

run,stop to run/stop simulation

add,rm to add/rm node

links:

add,rm to add/rm link

### attacks
split: split nodes to 2 groups

power(>1/2): let one node superior power to create alternative chain (rewrite history)
